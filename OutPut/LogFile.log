You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone. You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Are the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Are the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the
checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone. You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Are the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Are the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the
checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."

A batch application has been in production unchanged for over two years. It runs overnight once a month to produce statements that will be e-mailed to customers. For each customer, the application goes through every account and lists every transaction on that account in the last month. It uses a nested-loop structure to process customers (outer loop), each customer’s accounts (middle loop), and each account’s transactions (inner loop).
One night, the batch application terminates prematurely, failing to e-mail statements to some customers, when it encounters a customer with one account for which no transactions occurred in the last month. This is a very unusual situation and has not occurred in the years since this application was placed in production.
While fixing the defect, a programmer asks you to recommend test techniques that are effective against this kind of defect. Which of the following test techniques would most likely have been able to detect the underlying defect?

[INFO ] 2023-02-01 09:02:21 [main] Log - Question #5.2.20
You are the test manager for a user acceptance test project. You have decided to use a requirements-based and risk-based test strategy. Test suites have been designed to cover all of the requirements.
Table (below) shows the priority and the designed test suites associated with the requirements (a lower priority number means higher risk).
The table also shows the configuration of the test environment in which the requirements can be tested. Thus two different configurations, ABC and XYZ, are required to execute all test suites.
Assume that the test environment is delivered initially to the test team under the configuration ABC; XYZ will be available from the start of week 4. Each test suite will take approximately 1 week to execute.
The execution of TS4 depends on TS3 to be executed before, and the execution of TS2 depends on TS1 to be executed before.
Based only on the given information, which of the following test execution schedules would be preferred given the constraints of the test environment and the test strategy chosen?

You are working as a project manager on an in-house banking software project. To prevent rework and excessive find/fix/retest cycles, the following process has been put in place for resolving a defect once it is found in the test lab:
a) The assigned developer finds and fixes the defect, then creates an experimental build
b) A peer developer reviews, unit tests, and confirmation tests the defect fix on his/her desktop
c) A tester – usually the one who found the defect – confirmation tests the defect fix in the development environment
d) Once a day, a new release with all confirmed defect fixes included, is installed in the test environment
e) The same tester from step 3 confirmation tests the defect fix in the test environment
Nevertheless, a large number of defects which the testers confirmed as fixed in the development environment (in step 3) are somehow failing confirmation testing in the test environment, with the resulting rework and cycle time outcomes. You have the highest confidence in your testers, and have ruled out mistakes or omissions in step 3.

A test plan included the following clauses among the exit criteria:   
# System test shall continue until all significant product risks have been covered to the extent specified in the product risk analysis document   
# System test shall continue until no must-fix defects remain against any significant product risks specified in the product risk analysis document   
During test execution, the test team detects 430 must-fix defects prior to release and all must-fix defects are resolved. After release, the customers find 212 new defects, none of which were detected during testing. This means that only 67% of the important defects were found prior to release, a percentage which is well below average in your industry. You are asked to find the root cause for the high number of field failures. Consider the following list of explanations:   
I. Not all the tests planned for the significant product risks were executed   
II. The organization has unrealistic expectations of the percentage of defects that testing can find   
III. A version-control issue has resulted in the release of a version of the software that was used during early testing   
IV. The product risk analysis failed to identify all the important risks from a customer point of view   
V. The product risk analysis was not updated during the project as new information became available

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone.
You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Is the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Is the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone.
You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Is the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Is the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."
Which of the following statements about your review is correct?
[INFO ] 2023-02-02 13:45:12 [main] Log - d) When testing safety-critical system, static testing has less value because dynamic testing finds the defects better.

You are working on a video game development project, using Agile methods. It is based on Greek mythology and history, and players can play key roles in scenarios such as the battles between the Greeks and Trojans.
Consider the following user story and its associated acceptance criteria:
As a player, I want to be able to acquire the Rod of Midas (a new magic object), so that I can turn objects and other players into gold
AC1: The Rod must work on any object or player, no matter what size, which can be touched anywhere by the player holding the Rod
AC2: Holding the Rod does not change the player holding it into gold
AC3: Any object or player touched by the Rod transforms completely into gold within one millisecond
AC4: The Rod appears as shown in Prototype O.W.RoM
AC5: The transformation starts at the point of contact with the Rod and moves at a rate of one meter per millisecond
You are participating in a checklist-based review session of this user story.

A batch application has been in production unchanged for over two years. It runs overnight once a month to produce statements that will be e-mailed to customers. For each customer, the application goes through every account and lists every transaction on that account in the last month. It uses a nested-loop structure to process customers (outer loop), each customer’s accounts (middle loop), and each account’s transactions (inner loop).
One night, the batch application terminates prematurely, failing to e-mail statements to some customers, when it encounters a customer with one account for which no transactions occurred in the last month. This is a very unusual situation and has not occurred in the years since this application was placed in production.
While fixing the defect, a programmer asks you to recommend test techniques that are effective against this kind of defect. Which of the following test techniques would most likely have been able to detect the underlying defect?

You are working as a project manager on an in-house banking software project. To prevent rework and excessive find/fix/retest cycles, the following process has been put in place for resolving a defect once it is found in the test lab:
a) The assigned developer finds and fixes the defect, then creates an experimental build
b) A peer developer reviews, unit tests, and confirmation tests the defect fix on his/her desktop
c) A tester – usually the one who found the defect – confirmation tests the defect fix in the development environment
d) Once a day, a new release with all confirmed defect fixes included, is installed in the test environment
e) The same tester from step 3 confirmation tests the defect fix in the test environment
Nevertheless, a large number of defects which the testers confirmed as fixed in the development environment (in step 3) are somehow failing confirmation testing in the test environment, with the resulting rework and cycle time outcomes.

You are the test manager for a user acceptance test project. You have decided to use a requirements-based and risk-based test strategy. Test suites have been designed to cover all of the requirements.
Table (below) shows the priority and the designed test suites associated with the requirements (a lower priority number means higher risk).
The table also shows the configuration of the test environment in which the requirements can be tested. Thus two different configurations, ABC and XYZ, are required to execute all test suites.
Assume that the test environment is delivered initially to the test team under the configuration ABC; XYZ will be available from the start of week 4. Each test suite will take approximately 1 week to execute.
The execution of TS4 depends on TS3 to be executed before, and the execution of TS2 depends on TS1 to be executed before.

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone.
You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Is the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Is the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."
Which of the following statements about your review is correct?

A batch application has been in production unchanged for over two years. It runs overnight once a month to produce statements that will be e-mailed to customers. For each customer, the application goes through every account and lists every transaction on that account in the last month. It uses a nested-loop structure to process customers (outer loop), each customer’s accounts (middle loop), and each account’s transactions (inner loop).
One night, the batch application terminates prematurely, failing to e-mail statements to some customers, when it encounters a customer with one account for which no transactions occurred in the last month. This is a very unusual situation and has not occurred in the years since this application was placed in production.
While fixing the defect, a programmer asks you to recommend test techniques that are effective against this kind of defect. Which of the following test techniques would most likely have been able to detect the underlying defect?

You are working as a project manager on an in-house banking software project. To prevent rework and excessive find/fix/retest cycles, the following process has been put in place for resolving a defect once it is found in the test lab:
a) The assigned developer finds and fixes the defect, then creates an experimental build
b) A peer developer reviews, unit tests, and confirmation tests the defect fix on his/her desktop
c) A tester – usually the one who found the defect – confirmation tests the defect fix in the development environment
d) Once a day, a new release with all confirmed defect fixes included, is installed in the test environment
e) The same tester from step 3 confirmation tests the defect fix in the test environment
Nevertheless, a large number of defects which the testers confirmed as fixed in the development environment (in step 3) are somehow failing confirmation testing in the test environment, with the resulting rework and cycle time outcomes. You have the highest confidence in your testers, and have ruled out mistakes or omissions in step 3.

You are the test manager for a user acceptance test project. You have decided to use a requirements-based and risk-based test strategy. Test suites have been designed to cover all of the requirements.
Table (below) shows the priority and the designed test suites associated with the requirements (a lower priority number means higher risk).
The table also shows the configuration of the test environment in which the requirements can be tested. Thus two different configurations, ABC and XYZ, are required to execute all test suites.
Assume that the test environment is delivered initially to the test team under the configuration ABC; XYZ will be available from the start of week 4. Each test suite will take approximately 1 week to execute.
The execution of TS4 depends on TS3 to be executed before, and the execution of TS2 depends on TS1 to be executed before.
Based only on the given information, which of the following test execution schedules would be preferred given the constraints of the test environment and the test strategy chosen?

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone.
You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Is the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Is the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."
Which of the following statements about your review is correct?
[INFO ] 2023-02-02 16:52:24 [main] Log - d) When testing safety-critical system, static testing has less value because dynamic testing finds the defects better.

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone.
You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Is the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Is the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone.
You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Is the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Is the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."
Which of the following statements about your review is correct?
[INFO ] 2023-02-02 17:02:43 [main] Log - d) When testing safety-critical system, static testing has less value because dynamic testing finds the defects better.

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone.
You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Is the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Is the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."
Which of the following statements about your review is correct?

You are testing a new version of software for a coffee machine. The machine can prepare different types of coffee based on four categories. i.e., coffee size, sugar, milk, and syrup. The criteria are as follows:
- Coffee size (small, medium, large),
- Sugar (none, 1 unit, 2 units, 3 units, 4 units),
- Milk (yes or no),
- Coffee flavor syrup (no syrup, caramel, hazelnut, vanilla).
Now you are writing a defect report with the following information:
Title: Low coffee temperature. Short summary: When you select coffee with milk, the time for preparing coffee is too long and the temperature of the beverage is too low (less than 40 °C ) Expected result: The temperature of coffee should be standard (about 75 °C).

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone.
You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Is the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Is the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."
Which of the following statements about your review is correct?

The project develops a "smart" heating thermostat. The control algorithms of the thermostat were modeled as Matlab/Simulink models and run on the internet connected server. The thermostat uses the specifications of the server to trigger the heating valves.
The test manager has defined the following test strategy/approach in the test plan:
1. The acceptance test for the whole system is executed as an experience-based test.
2. The control algorithms on the server are tested during implementation using continuous integration.
3. The functional test of the thermostat is performed as risk-based testing.
4. The security tests of data / communication via the internet are executed together with external security experts.

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone.
You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Is the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Is the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."

You will be invited to a review. The work product to be reviewed is a description of the in-house document creation process. The aim of the description is to present the work distribution between the different roles involved in the process in a way that can be clearly understood by everyone.
You will be invited to a checklist-based review. The checklist will also be sent to you. It includes the following points:
i. Is the person who performs the activity clearly identified for each activity?
ii. Is the entry criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iii. Is the exit criteria clearly defined for each activity?
iv. Are the supporting roles and their scope of work clearly defined for each activity?
In the following we show an excerpt of the work result to be reviewed, for which you should use the checklist above:
"After checking the customer documentation for completeness and correctness, the software architect creates the system specification. Once the software architect has completed the system specification, he invites testers and verifiers to the review. A checklist describes the scope of the review. Each invited reviewer creates review comments - if necessary - and concludes the review with an official review done-comment."

You are testing a new version of software for a coffee machine. The machine can prepare different types of coffee based on four categories. i.e., coffee size, sugar, milk, and syrup. The criteria are as follows:
- Coffee size (small, medium, large),
- Sugar (none, 1 unit, 2 units, 3 units, 4 units),
- Milk (yes or no),
- Coffee flavor syrup (no syrup, caramel, hazelnut, vanilla).
Now you are writing a defect report with the following information:
Title: Low coffee temperature. Short summary: When you select coffee with milk, the time for preparing coffee is too long and the temperature of the beverage is too low (less than 40 °C ) Expected result: The temperature of coffee should be standard (about 75 °C). Degree of risk: Medium Priority: Normal

You are responsible for applying the correct technique for review of the requirements document for a project to develop a new software application. You identify the reviewers and the required roles, including the meeting leader, who is the requirements document author, and a separate role for scribe. Additionally, you decide to take a relatively informal approach to the requirements review. The goal of the review is to find defects in the requirements document such as omissions, inconsistencies, and duplications. Another goal of the review is to improve the software application's usability and accessibility by considering the various stakeholder's viewpoints.
